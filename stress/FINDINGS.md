# Stress findings

## How this file is used

1. **Write a stress package and its key**, key first, from source, before running anything.
2. **Run it. Record every disagreement here** — as a finding with an ID, a category and a
   status. Do not fix anything yet.
3. **Fix them one at a time**, each with a regression test the day it is written (T3.4e),
   and **re-run the phase-0 measurement after each one**.

**One fix per measurement, always.** Every fix moves the grid; batch three and you cannot
say which one moved what, and attributable numbers are the only thing this project has.

**The category is the point, not the prose.** A single finding is a bug. The same category
appearing in three stress packages is a design fault, and that is what the register below
exists to make countable. Findings that turn out to be errors in the *key* are tagged
`key-error` and kept — a key is evidence, and a benchmark that quietly edits itself to agree
with the code has stopped measuring anything.

## Register

| ID | Category | Status | One line |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1-01 | `identity` | **fixed** | band 0 deduplicated on `match_key()` and destroyed facts |
| S1-02 | `construct-coverage` | open | top-level `INSERT … SELECT … UNION ALL` refused, wrong reason |
| S1-03 | `flow-classification` | open | `GROUP BY` columns emitted as filter edges |
| S1-04 | `refusal-taxonomy` | open | `INSERT … VALUES` from variables refused; §3 makes variables first-class |
| S1-05 | `identity` | open | label format cannot express five facts in one file |
| S1-06 | `key-error` | closed | two gaps in my own key, stated rather than quietly fixed |

**`identity` has two entries already, and they are the same weakness at two layers** —
band 0 deduplicates on `match_key()`, and the label format keys on `match_key()`. S1-01 was
the analyser half and is fixed; S1-05 is the harness half and is not. If a third turns up in
stress 2, the match key stops being a scoring decision and becomes an IR decision.

**Categories, so far.** `identity` · `construct-coverage` · `flow-classification` ·
`refusal-taxonomy` · `key-error`. Add one only when nothing existing fits, and say why.

## Stress test 1

362 lines, 13 program units, 68 hand-labelled edges written from source before the analyser
was run over the file. Six forbidden-edge rules, three expected boundaries.

**Zero forbidden edges produced.** None of the six named wrong answers fired — including the
UDF argument read as a value source, the window `PARTITION BY` read as a value source, and
path fusion through `tmp_recent`. Those are the failures that matter most and the corpus
defences held at four times the package size they were built against.

## Score

| band / flow | precision | recall |
|---|---|---|
| 0 value | 100% | 87.5% |
| 0 filter | **58.3%** | 77.8% |
| 1 value — the gate | **95.5%** | 87.5% |
| 1 filter | 100% | 84.6% |
| 2 value | 100% | 100% |
| 2 filter | 100% | 100% |

Guard accuracy 100% of 10. Parse coverage 75% (12 statements seen, 9 analysed).

**The gate clears its floor by 0.5 points**, against 1.2 on the phase-0 corpus. On a file
four times the size, written to be awkward.

## S1-01 · `identity` · FIXED — band 0 deduplicated on `match_key()` and destroyed facts

`match_key()` is `(source, target, flow, transform)` — no guard, no origin. Band 0 collapsed
its edge set on that key before returning, so **two procedures writing the same columns
produced one edge**. The survivor kept one origin, one band and one guard; the other fact was
gone before it ever reached the IR — not refused, not declared, not counted.

This is worse than the scoring-layer collision ADR-0001 amendment 1b measured, because there
the ledger still holds both. Here the second fact never exists. It also made `procedure.py`'s
comment — *"merge on ledger identity so two facts differing only by guard or origin both
survive"* — a statement about something that had already happened upstream.

**Same root cause as S1-05**, one layer earlier: both key on `match_key()`, which carries
neither guard nor origin.

**How it showed up:** `stress_dynamic_mixed`'s constant `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` is recovered
correctly and yields three band-2 edges. `stress_transaction_control` writes the same three
columns of `FCT_REVENUE_STAGE` statically. The static edges sorted first, and **the entire
recovered dynamic statement disappeared** — while the dynamic-SQL machinery reported success.
Band-2 value recall read 40%, and the cause was nothing to do with dynamic SQL.

**Fix:** deduplicate on `identity()`. **Free on the phase-0 corpus — every cell
byte-identical**, because those packages are small enough that two statements rarely write
the same pair. Band-2 value recall here went **40% → 100%**. Pinned by
`tests/test_band0.py::test_two_units_writing_the_same_columns_both_survive`.

## S1-02 · `construct-coverage` · OPEN — top-level `INSERT … SELECT … UNION ALL` is refused, with the wrong reason

`stress_set_ops` is refused as **"INSERT ... VALUES carries no column lineage from a
relation"**. It is not an `INSERT ... VALUES`; it is an `INSERT ... SELECT` whose expression
SQLGlot parses as `exp.Union` rather than `exp.Select`, and the band-0 analyser treats
anything that is not a `Select` as `VALUES`.

The whole statement is dropped — **five labelled edges, including both `UNION` arms.**

**Why the corpus missed it:** `s5_positional_union` wraps its `UNION` in a subquery
(`SELECT col_a, col_b FROM ( … UNION ALL … )`), so the INSERT's expression is a `Select` and
the set-operation path is reached. The form real ETL actually writes — `UNION` directly under
the INSERT — was never covered.

It is at least declared rather than silent, so it is a loud failure. But the reason given is
false, and anyone reading the boundary would look for a `VALUES` clause that is not there.

## S1-03 · `flow-classification` · OPEN — `GROUP BY` columns are emitted as filter edges

Three of the five band-0 filter false positives are `GROUP BY` columns:
`STG_ORDERS.ORDER_DATE`, `STG_ORDER_LINES.PRODUCT_ID` → `relation:FCT_PRODUCT_SALES`, plus
`STG_ORDER_LINES.LINE_AMOUNT` from the `HAVING`.

`GROUP BY` does not select rows; it decides which rows aggregate together. Two of those
columns are **already value sources** for the projected `period_month` and `product_id`, so
emitting them again as filter influence double-counts one relationship under two flows. The
`HAVING` is arguably a genuine filter — it selects groups — and that half may be correct.

Needs a decision, not a patch. Recorded rather than fixed.

## S1-04 · `refusal-taxonomy` · OPEN — `INSERT … VALUES` from variables is still refused

Three misses, all of the same shape: `INSERT INTO tmp_recent VALUES (v_cust_id,
v_last_login)` and the audit write inside the exception handler. The refusal reason —
*"carries no column lineage from a relation"* — is true of relations and false of variables,
which ADR-0001 §3 makes first-class nodes.

Already the one false abstention in the phase-0 measurement (`s6`). This test adds three more
instances and shows the shape is common: writing a temp table row-by-row from cursor
variables is ordinary PL/SQL.

## S1-05 · `identity` · OPEN — the label format could not express five facts in one file

The **first draft of the key was rejected by the validator.** Five genuine facts, each
written by two different procedures in this one file, collide on the match key — and unlike
`b1_02`/`b1_03`/`b1_09`/`s7`, **guard does not separate them.** All ten edges are
unconditional. Only origin does, and origin was measured out of the key.

```
STG_ORDERS.CUST_ID    -> FCT_REVENUE.CUST_ID       set_ops : udf_caller
STG_ORDERS.ORDER_DATE -> FCT_REVENUE.PERIOD_MONTH  set_ops : udf_caller
STG_ORDERS.CURRENCY   -> FCT_REVENUE (filter)      set_ops : udf_caller
STG_CUSTOMER.EMAIL    -> DIM_CUSTOMER.EMAIL        merge_upsert : cursor_for_loop
DIM_CUSTOMER.CUST_ID  -> DIM_CUSTOMER (filter)     trg_recent_audit : cursor_for_loop
```

Two differ in **band** as well (0 vs 1, 1 vs 2), so the collision forces a choice about which
band the fact is scored in, and the losing band's recall is charged for a fact that is
genuinely there.

**Same root cause as S1-01**, one layer later: the analyser deduplicated on `match_key()`
and so does the key. Fixing the analyser half did not help here, because the key still cannot
hold both facts to score them against.

**This is the sharpest result in the run.** Amendment 1b concluded origin has no useful role
in the scoring layer, and it was right *about the phase-0 corpus*, where packages hold one to
three units. This file holds thirteen — ordinary for real code — and the collision appears
immediately. **The conclusion does not survive contact with package size**, and the
production package, when it arrives, will be larger than this one.

It also masked S1-02: `set_ops` contributes **zero** edges, yet two of its labels still
matched, because `udf_caller` happens to write the same columns. A whole statement was lost
and the score barely moved.

## S1-06 · `key-error` · CLOSED — two gaps in my own key

Stated because a key is evidence and its errors are part of the result.

- **The `EXISTS` correlation's second operand.** I labelled `STG_ORDERS.CUST_ID` as the filter
  source and omitted `STG_CUSTOMER.CUST_ID`. `s7`'s key labels *both* operands, so the
  analyser is right and the key was incomplete.
- **`BULK COLLECT` works.** I predicted a refusal and labelled none of it; the analyser
  correctly emits `STG_CUSTOMER.CUST_ID → variable:V_IDS` and the statement's `WHERE` filter.
  Two false positives that are the key's fault, not the analyser's.

Corrected in a later pass they would raise band-0 filter precision from 58.3% to roughly 80%.
Left uncorrected here so the first run stands as it was measured.

## What this says about the phase-0 numbers

Nothing directly — the phase-0 measurement is unchanged and re-verified byte-identical after
the fix. But three of the six findings are **artefacts of package size**, not of construct
difficulty, and the corpus cannot see them because every package in it is small. That is a
sharper version of the caveat the verdict already carries: the corpus is synthetic, and its
*shape* is as unrepresentative as its content.

## Fix order, and why not simply oldest first

Ordered by what each one would teach, not by how annoying it is.

1. **S1-02** (`construct-coverage`). Smallest, most certain, and the only one losing a whole
   statement. `INSERT … SELECT … UNION ALL` is ordinary ETL and the analyser already has the
   set-operation machinery — `s5` proves it works one level down.
2. **S1-04** (`refusal-taxonomy`). Needs a decision before code: the refusal is not wrong so
   much as *coarse*, and narrowing it costs parse coverage, which has **5.6 points of
   headroom against a kill criterion**. Measure before touching.
3. **S1-03** (`flow-classification`). A convention question, not a defect. Whatever is decided
   must be applied to the analyser *and* the phase-0 keys in the same change, or the two
   disagree silently.
4. **S1-05** (`identity`). Last, because it is the largest and the only one that moves every
   number in the phase. Do not start it until the production package has been measured — the
   verdict's condition still stands, and this is precisely the decision that wants real code
   in front of it rather than more synthetic evidence.

**A finding is not closed until a regression test fails without the fix.** Reproducing it
once in a stress run is a symptom; the test is the fix's only durable statement.
